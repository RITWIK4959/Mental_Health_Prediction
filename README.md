## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit to collect user responses through radio buttons and dropdowns.
- **ML Model Integration**: Uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on mental health survey data.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Instantly provides feedback based on inputs.
- **Extensible Pipeline**: Easily update the model or input logic to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Fully in Python**: The entire codebase is written in Python for accessibility and flexibility.
